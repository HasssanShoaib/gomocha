// orderTotalRow styling OrderSummaryView
// next button on AdditionalInfo
// width of progress bar on ConfirmationView
// Section marks for progress bar
// redo loading icon

// BASIC JS BUGGS FIXES AND FEATURES
// have a conditional that checks if userLocation is taken, and promps user if not. ex: Justin's phone stuck in loop because didn't have userLocation
// add conditions to Link buttons -- add class based on length of items array -- use addItemToOrderButton logic for additional info page condition
// make calls for time it will take to walk/bike/drive at same time you call getDetails
// share your order on Facebook.
// can't access prev or fav orders from SelectShopView


// LONG TERM MAJOR FEATURES
// Authentication using StormPath/Auth0 (passwordless?) - Google and Facebook auth
// get previous and favorite orders to work (need auth first)
// be able to search for shops in the area
// be able to start order from previous and favorites pages. replace items in state with items in prev/fav order
